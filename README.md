## Build Journey

I documented my entire build process on Twitter [@username](https://twitter.com/username), sharing insights, challenges, and solutions along the way. The journey included:

1. Initial research on color vision deficiency and dyslexia
2. Prototyping different approaches to color correction
3. Testing with users who have color vision deficiency
4. Iterating based on feedback
5. Adding features based on user needs

## Inspiration

The inspiration for VisionAid came from my personal commitment to digital accessibility. During the Bolt Hackathon, I set out to create a solution that would make the web truly inclusive. What started as a hackathon project has grown into a comprehensive suite of tools that help people with color vision deficiency and dyslexia access digital content effortlessly.
